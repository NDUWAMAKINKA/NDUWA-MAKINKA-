                  <p>Led a team of innovators and thinkers, fostering a culture of curiosity and exploration in the field of science and technology.My Journey with JETS Club,

I've been privileged to be part of the JETS (Junior Engineers, Technicians, and Scientists) Club, an experience that has profoundly shaped my passion for STEM. In Grade 11, I was appointed Vice President of the club, a role that came with immense responsibility and opportunity. It was a testament to the trust my mentors had in me, and I was determined to make the most of it. I poured my heart into leading the club, leveraging my love for reading and learning to contribute to the school community. The following year, I was appointed President, overseeing all club affairs and leading my peers to success in competitions. One of my proudest achievements was working on the Tesla Auxiliary Coil project, exploring the potential of kinetic energy from magnetic fields. I also delved into the development of a G-suit, designed to counteract the effects of high-speed flight on the human body. My journey with JETS began earlier, in Grade 10, when I collaborated with friend Emmanuel Sikazwe on a video game project, sparking my interest in computer programming and coding. These experiences have not only deepened my understanding of STEM concepts but also instilled in me a sense of purpose and leadership.</p>

The Tesla Auxiliary Coil project was a turning point in my journey, sparked by my friends Emmanuel Sikazwe and Kim Wandaba Mwenya during my 10th grade year. Emmanuel, then JETS President, was working on a video game, while Kim was exploring a chemical solution for household grease removal. Their passion was contagious, and I felt encouraged to pursue a project that ignited my own curiosity. I proposed the Tesla Auxiliary Coil, and we spent countless lunch breaks and walks home discussing its potential impact. This project fueled my desire to delve deeper into physics, chemistry, and mathematics, driving me to study harder and understand the underlying principles. The Tesla Auxiliary Coil concept showcases the power of magnetic fields around conductors, leveraging electromagnetism to generate kinetic energy. It's a testament to the laws of physics, which govern electric motors and offer endless possibilities for innovation. For me, this project was more than just an academic exercise – it was a gateway to new discoveries and a deeper understanding of the world around me.</p>

Being appointed Deputy Head Boy of my school in 12th grade was a huge honor. I was privileged to work under the guidance of Dr. Pastor Mighty Zunga, Mr. Chabula, and Mrs. Musonda, who mentored the prefecture board. This role taught me invaluable lessons in leadership, teamwork, and advocacy. I learned to amplify the voices of the vulnerable and voiceless, many of whom came from humble backgrounds and relied on school as their sole opportunity for growth.

I'm particularly grateful to my senior, Taylor Kachingwe, the Head Boy, who embodied humility and exceptional leadership. His ability to listen and empathize inspired me to adopt similar qualities. Together, we made a tangible impact on our school, notably by revitalizing the library, which had fallen into disrepair. With the support of my friends and patrons, we transformed it into a vibrant hub that catered to the needs of all students.

The experience and guidance I received have instilled in me a lasting sense of leadership and responsibility, for which I'll forever be grateful to Dr. Pastor Mighty Zunga, Mr. ChaBula, and Mrs. Musonda.</P>
